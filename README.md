# 🔐 Vigenère Cipher: Python Implementation

This project is a simple implementation of the **Vigenère Cipher**, used to **encrypt and decrypt text messages** using a keyword.

---

## 🚀 How It Works:
- Each letter in the message is shifted based on a corresponding letter from the key.
- The key repeats if it is shorter than the message.
- Non-alphabet characters (spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.

---

## 📌 Features:
- Supports encryption and decryption.
- Handles spaces and special characters correctly.
- Easy to modify and extend.

## 🛠️ Usage

### 📥 Example Input:
```python
text = 'mrttaqrhknsw ih puggrur'
custom_key = 'python'
